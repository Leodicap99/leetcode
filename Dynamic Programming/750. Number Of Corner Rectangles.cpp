/*
750. Number Of Corner Rectangles
Medium

Given a grid where each entry is only 0 or 1, find the number of corner rectangles.

A corner rectangle is 4 distinct 1s on the grid that form an axis-aligned rectangle. Note that only the corners need to have the value 1. Also, all four 1s used must be distinct.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = 
[[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one corner rectangle, with corners grid[1][2], grid[1][4], grid[3][2], grid[3][4].

 

Example 2:

Input: grid = 
[[1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]
Output: 9
Explanation: There are four 2x2 rectangles, four 2x3 and 3x2 rectangles, and one 3x3 rectangle.

 

Example 3:

Input: grid = 
[[1, 1, 1, 1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Rectangles must have four distinct corners.

 

Note:

    The number of rows and columns of grid will each be in the range [1, 200].
    Each grid[i][j] will be either 0 or 1.
    The number of 1s in the grid will be at most 6000.

ANSWER:-
/*
To find an axis-aligned rectangle, my idea is to fix two rows (or two columns) first, then check column by column to find "1" on both rows. Say you find n pairs, then just pick any 2 of those to form an axis-aligned rectangle (calculating how many in total is just high school math, hint: combination).

class Solution {
    public int countCornerRectangles(int[][] grid) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < grid.length; j++) {
                int counter = 0;
                for (int k = 0; k < grid[0].length; k++) {
                    if (grid[i][k] == 1 && grid[j][k] == 1) counter++;
                }
                if (counter > 0) ans += counter * (counter - 1) / 2;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
